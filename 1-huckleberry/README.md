# Huckleberry Agency Website

In this first workshop of mine, I am going to build a minimal landing page for an agency, a fictional consultancy.

It's based on the mockups provided by Josh (see Josh's [README](https://github.com/css-for-js/huckleberry) file).

I am going to use **FLOW LAYOUT**:

* no flexbox
* no grid
* no absolute positioning

The project relies heavily on:

* padding
* margin
* border

1. **the workshop subfolder created** > workshop's **zip file** has been downloaded and unzipped in the **local git subfolder** and pushed into this repo
`git add -A` and `git commit -m "Add the workshop's files"` and `git push`
2. **the command `npm install` entered** > the node_modules folder with necessary packages created
3. **the command `npm start` executed** > let's start coding ...

... and I am done now âœ…
