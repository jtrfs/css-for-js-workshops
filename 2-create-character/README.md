# Character Creator

In this workshop, I am asked to build a character creator for a Sims-style video game.

It follows the mockups provided by Josh (see Josh's [README](https://github.com/css-for-js/character-creator) file).

This project is built with **REACT** and uses **CSS Modules**.. CSS modules are ultimately very similar to vanilla CSS, but the classes are applied in JS. Additionally, a few global styles can be found in src/index.css.

```js
/* Something.module.css */
.wrapper {
  width: 500px;
}
```

```js
/* Something.js */
import styles from "./Something.module.css";

function Something() {
  return <div className={styles.wrapper}>I'll be 500px wide!</div>;
}
```

This workshop is divided into several parts/**exercises**:

- Exercise 1: **Fix footer links** ✅

- Exercise 2: **Layout adjustments** ✅

- Exercise 3: **Overflow**

- Exercise 4: **Perspective decoration**
