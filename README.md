## About the workshops

#### Josh says:

> _Workshops are **real-world-inspired problems**. The project and its goals are described in depth in the project's README file, though you'll be given the gist of the project here in the course materials. You might not be able to solve the workshop, and that's OK. Some workshops are super challenging. **It's about the journey, not the destination**._

#### Here's the recommended path:

1. If you get stuck or don't know how to proceed, you can **review the lessons** in this module.
2. Spend up to **2 hours working on the problem**. If you get discouraged or frustrated, you can stop earlier!
3. After you've invested a good chunk of time into the problem, **watch the solution video** (embedded in the next lesson). I'll show you how I'd approach this problem.
